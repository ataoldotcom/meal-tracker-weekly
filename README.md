# meal-tracker-weekly
 -The Meal tracker calculates the calories consumed per day, then totals this into a weekly caloric intake. It incorporates a jinja template to format the output. Additionally a python dictionary is used to simplify the users meal data inputs, name, and daily calorie goal. These are three user defined variables and key-value pairs. The python script includes a dictionary defined by the user. And a series of code to import the jinja template, calculate the daily caloric intake into a weekly total, and render the dictionary into the template format. Within the jinja template there are two separate outputs of how the weekly calorie total displays dependent upon if the user remained under or went over the goal. As well as a visual queue to denote if the meal was high protein or not.
